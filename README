To get started, start up your Lisp system inside this directory, and
enter (load "loadme.lisp").  You should see output from self-tests and
sample tests.  One of the sample suites, money.lisp, has deliberate
test failures; the others should all pass.

Manifest:

  clickcheck.lisp       The main testing package.
  documentation.text    Quick-start guide and reference.

  click-check.asd       ASDF system definition.
  updoc.lisp            Experimental documentation- and regression-tester.
  alpha.lisp            Utility for testing macros, also experimental.
  other files           Sample tests.

Thanks to Gregory Martin Pfeil for click-check.asd.
