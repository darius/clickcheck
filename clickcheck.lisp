; A library for test-driven development -- see self-test.lisp for an
; example of how to use it.

; This code could be simpler if we just printed test results to the
; console as each one gets computed, and always jumped right into the
; debugger on failure.  But that's not the behavior I want:

; First, in a test-driven style, we write the test first, then run it
; and see it fail, then fix the code, then rerun the test.  Jumping
; into the debugger on failure is a waste of time in that scenario
; (although if the debugger somehow knew to open the editor positioned
; right where you need to fix the code, that could change things).
; Normally after running a test suite we want just a quick indication
; of what's wrong, if anything, with the expectation that the problem
; is usually an obvious consequence of your last change.  You should
; set up your environment so that rerunning the tests is just a
; keystroke away.  Maybe it'd be a good thing to have separate
; keystrokes for expecting failure vs. expecting success (jumping into
; the debugger in the latter case).

; Second, it's convenient to write multiple tests over the same random
; test cases, like (for-all (x) (test1 x) (test2 x)).  Coherent
; reporting groups by test, not by test case.  OTOH the natural
; evaluation order groups evaluation by test case; that's the order I
; chose, though I wonder if it's not the best choice.

; Third, with QuickCheck's random test case generation, you can expect
; to get a large number of failing test cases.  We'd like to see some
; sort of summary of them before debugging.

; So the design here has us completing all the tests before reporting
; on any of them.  While we're still running the tests we output just
; a "progress bar" of dots.

; TODO:
;  rest of quickcheck
;    trivial-if 
;    histograms
;    function generation
;  check whether defaults for *num-trials* and *size* work well
;  more useful behavior in the debugger after a failure
;    a restart to retry the failed test
;    a restart to single-step through the failed test again
;  better naming?  i'm not very happy with some of the exported names.
;  more generators - chars, symbols, strings?
;  output in the format expected by some cross-language test runner
;  change to use CL conditions instead of dynamic function variable?
;  use ASSERT and *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS* ?
;  use type names in place of generator names?
;  make PRINT-TEST the default printer for test structs?
;  noticeably slow in CLISP - worth tuning?
;  see farther-out stuff in ideas file
