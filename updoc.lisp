; This code goes with the clickcheck test library -- the idea is to
; make it so easy to put together a regression test suite that there's
; no excuse not to.  Even without such a suite, you normally check out
; your code interactively at the Lisp prompt; so the idea here is you
; paste a transcript of the successful interactions right into your
; source file and it gets regression-checked automatically from then
; on.  (Python's doctest module and E's Updoc follow the same strategy
; -- this is an imitation of them.  Not a very good imitation, I'm
; afraid -- for one thing, the syntax is MCL-specific.)

; E's Updoc is designed to check the examples in documentation files,
; so we could hardly call this a Lisp version without that feature as
; well.  It has at least two benefits: keeping documentation from
; going stale, and more subtly to help prevent tests from becoming
; weaker over time as harried programmers fix them to keep passing
; after changes to the code, because the tests are in the
; documentation and you need to keep the examples in your docs up to
; date for your customers anyway (he said naively).

; The syntax in doc files is kind of unfortunate: we still need #{} 
; wrapping like the corresponding read macro in Lisp files.

; We ought to try doing something about testing examples from doc
; strings -- does anyone put many examples there?
 
; I'll bet it'd help if, on test failure, your IDE could give you the
; option of updating the test to follow the newer results.  (Instead
; of manually editing them.)
